# swift-everywhere-samples

## Requirements

- macOS 11.x
- Xcode 12.x
- Android Studio 4.1
- Android NDK 21.3.6528147

## Usage

1. Make sure that you have [Swift Android Toolchain](https://github.com/vgorloff/swift-everywhere-toolchain). You can either build it or download [pre-build](https://github.com/vgorloff/swift-everywhere-toolchain/releases) version.

2. Make sure that you have a symlink to NDK directory at `/usr/local/ndk/21.3.6528147`. It should be the **same** as already defined in `android.ndkVersion` in Gradle build configuration file (See: `Android/app/build.gradle`).

   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/ndk
   sudo ln -vsi ~/Library/Android/sdk/ndk/21.3.6528147 /usr/local/ndk/21.3.6528147
   ```

3. Open folder `Android` in Android Studio and run it on Device or Android Simulator.

4. Edit path to `sdk.dir` in `local.properties`


Note: SPM is actually native to system and `#if os(Android)` does not work in Package.swift
Workaround: 
Comment out `#if os(Android)` line and closing `#endif`.
